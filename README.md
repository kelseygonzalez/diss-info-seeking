# Dissertation Appendix 2: Information Seeking Behaviors for Information on COVID-19 Vaccinations

Previous research has greatly failed to distinguish between the activation of infor- mation seeking behaviors 
online and offline. Using theories of 1) social support and 2) uses and gratifications theory I investigate the
factors associated with each type of information search: personal connection, doctor, social networking site, 
online fo- rum, and online search engine. Using novel survey data of 948 Americans and their experience seeking
out information about the COVID-19 vaccines, I find little evi- dence that online search is more utilized than 
seeking social support from personal network connections or health professionals. I find evidence that the 
modalities queried in this survey are conceptually different and that the utilization of different modalities 
varies by demography and information exposure points, where individu- als are provided with information without
seeking it. Finally, I find that different sources of information exposure and information search modalities
hold real world consequences through their associations with COVID-19 vaccination intentions and rates, as
information from a doctor increases COVID-19 vaccination uptake while receiving information from a social networking
site is associated with lower odds of vaccination.
